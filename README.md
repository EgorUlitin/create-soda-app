## Getting Started

Install it once globally:

```sh
yarn add global create-soda-app
```

or

```sh
npm install -g create-soda-app
```

**You’ll need to have Node >= 6 on your machine**. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

### Creating an App

To create a new app, run:

```
create-soda-app my-app
cd my-app
```

It will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.
