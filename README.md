### Start Coding Now

You **don't** need to install or setup Webpack or Babel.
They come packaged with `next`, so you can just start coding.

After running `create-soda-app`, you're good to go!

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install it once globally:

```sh
yarn add global create-next-app
```

or

```sh
npm install -g create-soda-app
```

**You’ll need to have Node >= 6 on your machine**. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

**You don't need to use Node as your primary backend**. The Node installation is only required for Create Next App and running the Next.js server in development/production.

### Creating an App

To create a new app, run:

```
create-soda-app my-app
cd my-app
```

It will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.
